## Some numbers:

- XX SNPs were imputed
- on average, XX SNPs were used as tag SNPs
- in total, XX tag SNPS were used
- Sample size ranges from XX to XX
- time used to impute

## sanity check: take some tag SNPs at random, remove them from the GWAS file, impute them, and check.

## here list all the SNPs that were in the GWAS dataset, but not found in the reference panel (therefore could not be utilized as tag SNPs)

## here list all the SNPs that were demanded in the option --impute.snp, but were not in the reference panel availalbe
