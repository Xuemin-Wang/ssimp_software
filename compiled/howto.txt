If stu is not installed, use the version in this repository. It can be built here with 'make stu/stu',
and then you can use 'stu/stu' instead of 'stu' in the rest of this document

## Version number update?
Before building the binaries, you probably want to update the version numbers. Currently, this means:
 - edit the first line of [doc/usage.txt]
 - edit the 'current version' entry in [README.md]
 - add a new entry to the top of [VERSION], regarding the changes introduced
The [doc/usage.txt] should be updated before compilation, as it will be included in the binary

## on LINUX (e.g. HPC1)

stu bin/ssimp-static   # to build the statically-linked version of the executable
cp bin/ssimp-static compiled/ssimp-linux-VERSION
git add compiled/ssimp-linux-VERSION
git rm  compiled/ssimp-linux-OLDVERSION
git commit -m "statically-linked executable for LINUX"


## on a MAC (e.g. sinaâ€™s computer)

## stu/stu bin/ssimp-static   # to build the statically-linked version of the executable
## >> failed, instead
Static compilation would help, but I did more investigation and it seems that static compilation will never be possible with Mac:

The 'crt' library was our problem and it appears that Apple refuse to make a static version of it available
