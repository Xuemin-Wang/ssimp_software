#ifndef ERROR_HH
#define ERROR_HH

/*
 * Code for managing errors in Stu.  Errors codes in Stu are represented
 * by integers between 0 and 4, as defined in the ERROR_* constants
 * below.  Zero represents no error.  These codes are used for both
 * Stu's exit status and as values that are thrown and caught.   Variables
 * containing error codes are ints and are named "error". 
 */ 

/*
 * Format of error output:  There are two types of error output lines:
 * error messages and traces.  Error messages are of the form 
 *
 *         $0: *** $MESSAGE
 * 
 * and traces are of the form 
 *
 *         $FILENAME:$LINE:$COLUMN: $MESSAGE
 *
 * Traces are used when it is possible to refer to a specific location
 * in the input files (or command line, etc.).  Error messages are
 * avoided: all errors should be traced back to a place in the source if
 * possible. But sometimes they must be used. 
 */

/*
 * Wording of messages:  Error messages begin with uppercase letters;
 * trace messages with lowercase letters, as per the GNU Coding
 * Standard.  Filenames and operator names are quoted in messages using
 * single quotes.  Messages for both types of error output lines are not
 * terminated by periods.   
 *
 * The general forms of error messages is:
 *
 *    Location 2: expected XXX, not YYY
 *    Location 1: in ZZZ	
 *
 *    Location 2: XXX must not be used
 *    Location 1: in YYY 
 *
 * Use "expected TOKEN" instead of "missing TOKEN".  That's because some
 * tokens in the given list may be optional, making the "missing"
 * phrasing confusing, as it would imply that the token is mandatory.
 * Include definite or indefinite articles after "expected" to avoid
 * interpreting "expected" as an adjective.  
 *
 * "not YYY" mentions the invalid token.  If end-of-file is encountered,
 * the "not ..." part is not used. 
 * 
 * Use "must not" rather than "cannot" or "shall" in error messages when
 * something must be present, but is erroneous, e.g., "filename must not
 * be empty".  On the other hand, use "cannot" when something completely
 * unexpected was encountered, e.g., "transient targets cannot be used
 * with copy rule".
 * 
 * But remember that in general it is better to state what what expected
 * in the syntax than to say that what was encountered cannot be used.
 * For instance, say "expected a filename" instead of "filename must not
 * be empty".  This cannot always be done, so "must not" is sometimes
 * used.

 * may combine errors 1 and 2, giving exit status 3.  Error 4 is
 * unrecoverable, and leads to Stu aborting immediately.  Error 4 is
 * never combined.  
 *
 * Build errors (code 1) are errors encountered during the normal
 * operation of Stu.  They indicate failures of the executed commands or

 * (question mode), when the targets are not up to date.

 * Logical errors (code 2) are errors with the usage of Stu.  These are
