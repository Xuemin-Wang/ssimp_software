Versions of SSIMP

(unreleased)    (2018-12-24)
                - replace missing ref panel samples with the mean of the SNV. And a simple
                  message, per region, of what fraction were replaced
                - .. and remove a SNV entirely if more than 5% is missing.

ssimp-0.5.4     (2018-11-16)
                - print '(ref)' and '(gwas)' when estimating the builds, so the output is more readable.
                - stop using the 'DISCARD_FILTERED' to 'libStatGen'. By using
                  it, we were discarding too much from the reference panel.

ssimp-0.5.3     (2018-11-14)
                - to save memory and time, load only a subset of the build
                  database for the relevant chromosomes. This applies if
                  --impute.range or --tag.range are specified.
                - print the version number when running, and adjustments to the tests to take account of this
                - fix for issue 88

ssimp-0.5.2     (2018-11-07)
                - various documentation updates
                - option for '--download.build.db' and '--download.1KG'
                - fix for issue59: reimpute at least 100 tags. https://github.com/zkutalik/ssimp_software/issues/59

ssimp-0.5.1     (2018-10-29)
                - offer to download the 1000genomes if it is requested via --ref

ssimp-0.5       (2018-10-21)
                Various fixes.
                - If a SNP has two identical alleles (e.g. "na"), then delete it (PR #70).
                - If the database version is incorrect, give a helpful error message on how to redownload it (PR #69).
                - To fix build estimation on small chromosomes (e.g. chr 22), use more SNPs (PR #69).
                - Add a 'Troubleshooting' section to the README.

ssimp-0.4       (2018-08-09)
                Bug fixe. See comment in pull request #63.

ssimp-0.3       (2018-01-20)
        Enable imputation of chromosome X.

        If you have been using previous versions of SSIMP,
        delete the file
        ~/reference_panels/database.of.builds.1kg.uk10k.hrc.bin,
        and replace it with the new version:

        rm       ~/reference_panels/database.of.builds.1kg.uk10k.hrc.bin
        cd       ~/reference_panels
            wget -c -nd    'https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/uOyjAtdvYjxxwZd/download' -O database.of.builds.1kg.uk10k.hrc.2018.01.18.bin

ssimp-0.2       (2018-01-09)
        efficient imputation of single SNPs
        added script that allows multiprocessing
                output has 3 more columns: P.imp, N.imp, bst.imp

ssimp-0.1       first release (2017-08-18)
