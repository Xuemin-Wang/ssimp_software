Versions of SSIMP

(unreleased)    (???)
                - to save memory and time, load only a subset of the build
                  database for the relevant chromosomes. This applies if
                  --impute.range or --tag.range are specified.
                - print the version number when running
                - fix for issue 88

                - various documentation updates
                - option for '--download.build.db' and '--download.1KG'
                - fix for issue59: reimpute at least 100 tags. https://github.com/zkutalik/ssimp_software/issues/59

ssimp-0.5       (2018-10-21)
                Various fixes.
                - If a SNP has two identical alleles (e.g. "na"), then delete it (PR #70).
                - If the database version is incorrect, give a helpful error message on how to redownload it (PR #69).
                - To fix build estimation on small chromosomes (e.g. chr 22), use more SNPs (PR #69).
                - Add a 'Troubleshooting' section to the README.
