This folder is to track traffic in a github folder. 

## 1) execute the A_get_github_traffic.sh file. This will read out csv files.
./A_get_traffic_github.sh csv

## 2) execute the B_eval_github_traffic.sh file. This will 1st bundle all the existing csv files in the csv folder and remove duplicated rows. And 2nd create graphs similar to the ones on github.
