This folder is to track traffic in a github folder. 

## 1) execute the A_github_traffic.sh file. This will read out csv files.
## 2) execute the B_github_traffic.sh file. This will 1st bundle all the existing csv files in the csv folder and remove duplicated rows. And 2nd create graphs similar to the ones on github. 

./B_github_traffic.sh folder-name
e.g. 
./B_github_traffic.sh csv
