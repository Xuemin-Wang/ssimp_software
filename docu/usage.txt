ssimp   GWASFILE REFPANEL IMPUTATIONOUTPUT  [OPTIONS]
ssimp   --gwas GWASFILE --ref REFPANEL --out IMPUTATIONOUTPUT

    GWASFILE                Path to an input file.
    REFPANEL                Either '1KG/EUR', or a path to a '*.vcf.gz' file.
    IMPUTATIONOUTPUT        Output file, to store the imputation results.


If you are happy to impute using the EUR population in 1000genomes, then
run the following command. The first time you run this, it will offer to
download the necessary data from 1000genomes to your harddrive, into
'~/reference_panels':

    ssimp gwas.txt 1KG/EUR output.txt

You can add extra options, defined below, for example:

    ssimp gwas.txt 1KG/EUR output.txt --impute.range 17

For examples, visit https://github.com/zkutalik/ssimp_software/blob/master/docu/examples.md

For more details of the method and usage, visit https://github.com/zkutalik/ssimp_software/blob/master/docu/manual.md

If you wish to use different reference panel (not 1000genomes), or a population
other than EUR, then a more complex command line is required.

See below for more details on how to download a reference panel. At least one
reference panel, with a population structure similar to your GWAS sample, must
be downloaded by you.

If you have already downloaded the 1000genomes reference panel (see below for
more details) to '~/reference_panels/1000genomes', then you can run this:

    ssimp  gwas.txt  ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/ALL.chr{CHRM}.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz output.txt --sample.names ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel/sample/super_pop=EUR

    ssimp  gwas.txt  ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/ALL.chr{CHRM}.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz --out output.txt --sample.names ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel/sample/super_pop=EUR


Options:

    None of these options are necessary.  If an option isn't specified, a
    default value (inside []) is used in it place.  For example, if --lambda X
    is not specified, it is equivalent to specifying --lambda "2/sqrt(n)".

    --sample.names  [use all]   Sample IDs of individuals to use in the
                                reference panel.
    --log           [none]      Store a copy of all console output to this file
    --impute.range  [use all]   Position range to be imputed (chr:start-chr:end)
    --impute.maf    [0]         Minimum MAF among SNPs to be imputed
    --impute.snp    [use all]   List of SNP id’s to be imputed
    --tag.range     [use all]   (same as impute.range, but applied to tag SNPs)
    --tag.maf       [0]         (same as impute.maf,   but applied to tag SNPs)
    --tag.snp       [use all]   (same as impute.snp,   but applied to tag SNPs)
    --lambda        [2/sqrt(n)] The lambda correction applied to the estimated
                                correlation matrix. Numeric value, or the
                                special string "2/sqrt(n)" where n is the
                                number of individuals in the reference panel.
    --window.width  [1000000]   Core window length
    --flanking.width [1000000]  Flanking space left and right of the core window
    --missingness   [none]      'none' (the default), or 'dep' or 'ind'


Reference panel:

You must download a reference panel to use this software: either automatically
or manually. We suggest the 1000genomes dataset as it is publicly available and 
includes many populations. 

If you use the 1000genomes dataset, then it is sufficient to read 'Reference panel 
(automatical download)'. If you want to use another reference panel, see 
'Reference panel (complex instructions)' below for more details.

The reference panel folder (named `reference_panels`) must be stored in the home directory.


Reference panel (automatical download):

By running `ssimp` with a special argument - `1KG/SUPER-POP` - assigned to the 
reference panel option, it will automatically download 1000 genomes reference 
panel and use the specified super population for imputation. 

For example, if we want 1000 genomes to be downloaded and EUR population used 
for imputation, we type: 

ssimp gwas/small.random.txt 1KG/EUR output.txt

Make sure that:
1) you have `wget` installed and
2) no folder `reference_panels` exists yet in your home directory. 


Reference panel (simple instructions):

If you have not already downloaded 1000genomes to your computer, first download
all the files in 'ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/'
to a directory on your computer. You can download each file individually from
your web browser, but it is more convenient to use 'wget' on the command line
if it is available on your machine:

    cd ~                # to your home directory
    mkdir -p reference_panels/1000genomes
    cd       reference_panels/1000genomes
    wget -c -nd -r 'ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/*.gz'
    wget -c -nd -r 'ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/*.tbi'
    wget -c -nd -r 'ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/*.panel'

Additionally, download the dataset that allows you fast imputation of single SNPs.

wget https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/uOyjAtdvYjxxwZd/download -O database.of.builds.1kg.uk10k.hrc.2018.01.18.bin

You can then pass this directory name to 'ssimp', and specify that only
the European individuals should be used:

    ssimp  gwas.txt ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/ALL.chr{CHRM}.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.g output.txt --sample.names ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel/sample/super_pop=EUR

'super_pop=EUR' can be replaced with other (super-)populations if necessary. E.g.

    super_pop=EAS        East Asian
    pop=TSI              Toscani in Italia

(This uses the 'integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel' file provided
with 1000genomes to find the sample names in the requested population. For more details on super_pop and pop, see
http://www.internationalgenome.org/category/population/.


Reference panel (complex instructions):

If you wish to use a different reference panel other than 1000genomes, you must
specify the filename of the .vcf.gz files. If you have 22 separate .vcf.gz files
(one for each chromosome), then replace the chromosome number with  {CHRM}  to
direct ssimp to replace that string with the chromosome number. For example:

    ssimp  gwas.txt              \
            ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/ALL.chr{CHRM}.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz \
           output.txt \
           --sample.names ~/reference_panels/1000genomes/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel/sample/super_pop=EUR

If the '--sample.names' option is not specified, all individuals in the
.vcf.gz file will be used. This is inappropriate in some cases (for example
with the 1000genomes data), as you should direct ssimp to use only the
individuals that match the ancestry of your GWAS. You can use '--sample.names'
in two ways. First, it can simply be a file with the sample IDs that you
wish to use. The sample IDs are the column names in the .vcf.gz file.
The second way is demonstrated in the example command line above, where you
can append the basic filename ('~/reference_panels/1000genomes/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel')
with a special extra string ('/sample/super_pop=EUR') which directs ssimp to use
the sample IDs from the 'sample' column of that basic filename and only
for the individuals with 'EUR' in the 'super_pop' field. This is a convenient
way to use any file (delimited by comma, space, or tab) which lists the
sample IDs and their population.

You can change 'super_pop=EUR' at the end of that command if you want to
use a different subpopulation, for example 'pop=TSI' or 'super_pop=EAS'.
